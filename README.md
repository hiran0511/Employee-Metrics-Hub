# Employee-Metrics-Hub (Interactive dashboard creation using MS Excel)
I developed interactive Excel dashboards to analyze employee and organizational data. Using Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, and KPIs, the project delivers insights into workforce demographics, performance &amp; engagement, and training &amp; departmental analysis.
## Objective
